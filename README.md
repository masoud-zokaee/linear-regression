# Linear Regression

Linear Regression project implementation

## Project description

Implementing a Linear Regression and locally weighted linear regression project with 
gradient descent methods. This project was part of a machine learning class final projects.

You can see the project detail here : 

https://github.com/masoud-zokaee/linear-regression/blob/master/project-linear-regression.pdf

All the implemented methods ( single/multi-value gradient descent - weighted gradient descent -
generalization error ) can be used separately in different codes.

## Prerequisites

Required python libraries 

1- numpy 2- sklearn 3- math

you can use commands like

```
pip install numpy

pip install sklearn

pip install math

```

## File description 

Provided python files uses the .csv file or library function "make_regression" the generate input samples.
The x input dimension in this project is (100,3), you can use the different number of inputs.
